          <p>My name is Colton Allen, and I am first and foremost a Web Developer.</p>
          <p>As an entrepreneur, owning and operating my own business for the past 12 years, I have picked up many skills and learned a lot. In the process, I, of course, had to create a website for my business, and I was captivated ever since.</p>
          <p>Business has been great, but the COVID-19 pandemic truly opened my eyes to the fact that my business was not foolproof. In desperate times, such as they were, business could fall flat in a moment’s time. This got me thinking and formulating another plan; a plan that is more stable for those I love.</p>
          <p>So, with the given extra time due to the pandemic, although difficult financially, I took to the Internet to pursue my passion — my true passion that’s been bubbling up beneath the surface.</p>
          <p>After several courses that I purchased and followed online, as well as endless hours of YouTube tutorials to accomplish projects that I was interested in, I am now looking to amalgamate into a team of fellow web enthusiasts.</p>
          <p>Utilizing modern programming languages such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript in conjunction with various frameworks and libraries such as React, TypeScript, Sass, Bootstrap, jQuery, amongst others, I have built many of my own apps and websites that I now would like to do full time. That’s where you come in.</p>
          <p>If you haven’t already, check out a few of my projects <Link to="/work">here</Link>. If you like what you see, you can get my contact information or send me a message <Link to="/contact">here</Link>.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for taking the time. I hope to get the opportunity to work with you.</p>
